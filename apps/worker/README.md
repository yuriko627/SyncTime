# Tonk Worker

A Tonk worker service for building local-first applications.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

4. Register the worker with Tonk:
   ```bash
   tonk worker register
   ```

## Worker Configuration

The worker is configured using the `worker.config.js` file. You can modify this file to change the worker's behavior.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file to configure the worker.
